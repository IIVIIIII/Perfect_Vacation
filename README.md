# Perfect_Vacation

A pair of jupyter notebooks designed to automate the process of finding vacation destinations with ideal weather. One notebook selects a large set of random cities, gets their weather information from the open weather API, and exports the data as a csv. The other notebook reads the exported csv, filters the cities based on desired weather conditions, and finds hotels in the remaining cities.
